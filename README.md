# Schwimmen

Aka EinunddreiÃŸig or ThirtyOne is a cardgame played with 32 cards and up to nine players.

# Rules:

Every Player is getting three cards. The goal of the game is to not be the one with the smallest card value. To achieve this
goal the player can swap either one or all of his cards with the three cards on the field, he is also allowed to skip a 
round or to "knock", which means that there's one last round left til the cards are counted.
When two cards have the same colour(for example spades) their value is added together.
The Value of a card is defined as followed:
* An ace has a value of 11
* A face card such as king, queen or jack has a value of 10
* Every card with a number has a value of this very number
* Three cards of the same face or number but different colour is defined as a value of 30 1/2
